<h1>IRMA privacy policy</h1>

<p>
This text briefly describes the privacy policy for (phase 1 of) the
pilot project IRMA. This project involves experimental use of
attribute-based identity management via smart cards. The text consists
of the following parts.

<a name="goals" ></a>
<h2>1. Goals</h2>

<p>
The overall goal of the IRMA project is to develop and evaluate an
experimental framework for privacy-friendly attribute-based identity
management using smart cards. To a restricted group of people in the
academic context in the Netherlands the possibility will be offered to
participate and obtain a smart card that can contain digital
attributes (properties) that hold for the Cardholder. These attributes
can be obtained from an Issuer, and can be checked by a Relying Party
in an authentication test as part of a (unspecified) transaction.
</p>


<a name="parties" ></a>
<h2>2. Relevant parties and scope</h2>

<p>
The IRMA project is in phase 1 a (non-profit, informal) cooperation
between:

<ul>
    <li>the Digital Security research group of the Radboud University 
      Nijmegen, hereafter RU;</li>
    <li>Surfnet;</li>
    <li>TNO-ICT Groningen, hereafter TNO.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The IRMA project involves (personal) data storage by four parties:

<ul type="A">
<li>a) The Cardholder participating voluntarily in the IRMA project,
    having data on his/her own IRMA card (and possibly historical
    transaction information at some personal external logging and
    inspection device, like a PC);</li>

<li>b) RU running the IRMA Backoffice, holding Cardholder information;</li>

<li>c) An Issuer that authenticates Cardholders and delivers attributes
    to their cards;</li>

<li>d) A Relying Party that verifies and uses attributes on IRMA smart
    cards. In phase 1 of the IRMA project a Relying Party can, in
    principle, read all attributes. (Restrictions will be imposed
    in later phases.)</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
This privacy policy covers party (b); parties (c) and (d) will be
responsible for their own privacy policy. Party (a) will be responsible
for the management of his/her own personal data.
</p>

<p>
The names `IRMA' and `IRMA project' may also be used in follow-up
activities. Therefor, the current text addresses "phase 1" of the
project.  A later phase may involve different parties and different
roles, and thus requires an adaptation of this privacy
policy. Whenever the terms `IRMA' and `IRMA project' are used in this
document without further qualification, they refer to this phase 1.
</p>

<a name="backoffice" ></a>
<h2>3. The IRMA backoffice</h2>
<p>
The IRMA backoffice will operate at, and under the responsability of,
the Digital Security group of the Radboud University Nijmegen (RU): it
will remain within the university infrastructure, and will not be
realised via the cloud, or via subcontractors. It will be used for the
application, production, hand-over, card-loss, and similar
administrative tasks during the life-cycle of IRMA smart
cards. Additionally, the Backoffice will keep a log of all
transactions. The Digital Security group will take appropriate
technical and organisational security measures in order to protect
personal data from being lost and from any type of unlawful
processing. Taking account of the state of technology and the cost of
implementing them, these measures will provide an appropriate level of
security in view of the risks associated with such processing and the
nature of the data being protected. Moreover, the data wil be used
only for the purposes described below.
</p><p>
There will be no third-party access to the data items. Derived
anonimised statistical information may be disclosed (like numbers of
participants, card-losses, errors, etc.) in reports and publications
about the IRMA project.
</p><p>
When a prospective Cardholder agrees to participate in the IRMA
project and explicitly consents to the data processing involved, the
following data will be stored in the IRMA backoffice, as part of the
application procedure for his/her personal IRMA card.

<ul>
<li>(a) First name + Last name</li>
<li>(b) Email address</li>
<li>(c) Photo of the Cardholder</li>
<li>(d) uid@institution identifier</li>
<li>(e) interaction log</li>
    <ul>
        <li>date+time</li>
        <li>log entry</li>
    </ul>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Ad (a) + (b): The name and email address will be used solely for
communication purposes.
</p><p>
Ad (c): The Photo of the Cardholder will be printed on the outside of
the card, and will not be present inside the (chip on the) smart card.
The Photo will be compared to a photo on a valid identity document at
card hand-over. Afterwards, the Photo will be kept in the database for
consistency checks, like in fraud detection, and in re-issuance of a
card after claimed card-losses.
</p><p>
Ad (d): The uid@institution is the identifier that Surfnet uses to
identify students and academic staff members in the Netherlands. It
will be incorporated in a "root credential" that is installed on an
empty card, before card hand-over. This root credential may be read
and used by both Issuers and Relying Parties.
</p><p>
Ad (e): The interaction log involves date, time, and source IP-adres
of a request for an IRMA card. These data will be used solely for
performance evaluation, problem solving, and fraud detection.
</p>

<p>
During the course of the project new functionality may be introduced
that requires additional processing of personal data. This will only
happen with explicit consent of the data subject, and will result in
an explicit description of the new purpose in this privacy policy.
</p>

<a name="duration" ></a>
<h2>4. Duration</h2>

<p>
The IRMA project (phase 1) will run during at most two (academic)
years, namely from 1 sept. 2013 to 1 sept. 2015. All personal data
will be deleted or anonymised soon as they are not necessary any
longer for the purpose of the processing activity. Such deletion will
surely happen within at most 6 months after termination of phase 1.
</p>

<p>
If there will be subsequent phases of the IRMA project, and if
personal data from phase 1 can be re-used in these later phases, this
will only happen with explicit consent of the data subject.
